# Darktide Crosshairs Fix

Darktide 1.4 fixed most issues with crosshairs but a few remain. Mod fixes remaining issues. Most notably I recently discovered that the vanilla crosshairs don't include spread ratio multipliers. 

Now includes shotshell pellet patterns. You can customize how spread is displayed with shotshell weapons via mod options.

The mod has a function that custom crosshairs can use to properly have diagonal segments (e.g. through crosshair remap). Additionally other mods can also read the active shotshell and shotshell spread via a function.

# Installation

Drop the crosshairs_fix folder into your mods folder. Add "crosshairs_fix" to your mod_load_order.txt

# Math

Original crosshairs equation:

    370 * tan(spread) / tan(current_vertical_fov / 2)

Result is the number of pixels your crosshair is placed from the center of the screen, scaled from 1080p as baseline. Assault is 555 instead of 370.

New equation:

    540 * tan(spread) / tan(current_vertical_fov / 2)

Also applied to assault crosshair.

# For Modders

Custom crosshairs (from Crosshair Remap or similar) should use a SPREAD_DISTANCE value of 10 and, as vanilla crosshairs have been updated to do, use horizontal_alignment and vertical_alignment of "center". If your crosshair has no diagonal segments this is all you need to do. Though you can still use the function for non-diagonal crosshairs to do things with a for loop instead of manually doing each segment of the crosshair. See example_crosshair.lua for examples of what I mean.

If you want diagonal crosshairs then use the crosshair_rotation function to get x, y coordinates. Check example_crosshair.lua for a rough example of how to use the function.

## crosshair_rotation(x, y, angle, half_crosshair_size, minimum_offset, texture_rotation)

* supplied with spread_offset_x and spread_offset_y and the angle of a crosshair segment, returns x and y coordinates adjusted for the rotation.

* half_crosshair_size is what it says. Be sure to use the correct dimension. Not optional.

* minimum_offset is the mininum number of 1080 pixels the returned x, y should be from center. e.g. a value of 1 at an angle of 45Â° would set a minumum x and y value of 0.707. optional.

* texture_rotation is an optional parameter in case the crosshair texture needs additional rotation. Be sure to also adjust the crosshair segment angles as needed. optional.

* As usual for lua all angles should be supplied in radians.
